# Banking Account

This is OOP project from [codeacademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/) curriculum in wich we have to make an `Account` class.

The idea is to create diferent public methods that can access the info of the account, and the validation is made through a PIN password using private methods.

For this project I added the following methods:

**Public Methods**
- `#display_balance`
- `#withdraw`
- `#deposit`

All this methods requiere that the password is introduced

**Private Methods**
- `#get_pin`
- `#pin`
- `#pin_error`

I use this methods to collect the PIN password and to valite the info in the public methods
